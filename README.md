# Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) Step Counting Optimum Combination
<p> It consists of 15 datasets from three different experiments from three different body parts (Ankle, Arm, Hand, Leg, Waist).
<p> Each file was derived from smartphone during pedestrian walking on a treadmill on three different speeds (3.3km/h, 4.6km/h and 5.9km/h respectively).
<p> Each file consists 33 parameters (Accelerometer x, Accelerometer y, Accelerometer z, Gravity x, Gravity y, Gravity z, Linear Accelerometer x, Linear Accelerometer y, Linear Accelerometer z, Gyroscope x, Gyroscope y, Gyroscope z, Light, Magnetic Field x, Magnetic Field y, Magnetic Field z, Orientation z, Orientation x, Orientation y, Promixity, Sound level, Location (latitude), Location (longitude), Location (Althitude), Location Altitude-google, Location Speed, Location Accuracy, Location Orientation, Satellites in range, GPS, Date and time)
<p> The sensors measurements used in the experiments include the Accelerometer x, Accelerometer y, Accelerometer z, Linear Accelerometer x, Linear Accelerometer y, Linear Accelerometer z, Gyroscope x, Gyroscope y, Gyroscope z, Magnetic Field x, Magnetic Field y and Magnetic Field z
<p> Analytically, the data for each speed are listed below:
<p>

<p> For 4.6km/h - select Time: 06:47:00:00-07:02:00:00
<p> For 5.9km/h - select Time: 07:03:00:00-07:18:00:00
<p>
<p> Experiment 2
<p> For 3.3km/h - select Time: 05:59:00:00-06:14:00:00
<p> For 4.6km/h - select Time: 06:15:00:00-06:30:00:00
<p> For 5.9km/h - select Time: 06:35:00:00-06:50:00:00
<p>
<p> Experiment 3
<p> For 3.3km/h - select Time: 06:19:00:00-06:34:00:00
<p> For 4.6km/h - select Time: 06:35:00:00-06:50:00:00
<p> For 5.9km/h - select Time: 06:51:00:00-07:06:00:00
